**Smart Cat: Intelligent Cat Care System**

**Overview**

Smart Cat is an intelligent system designed to support cat owners in monitoring and understanding their cats’ behaviors, habits, and needs.
In this phase of the project, I focus on integrating API-based data retrieval into the system — using real-world data sources to make the cat care experience more adaptive and data-driven. 

**Purpose**

This notebook demonstrates how APIs can enhance Smart Cat’s functionality.
By connecting to external data sources (e.g., weather or nutrition APIs), the system can make informed suggestions — for example, adjusting feeding times or indoor play activities based on temperature or daylight.

**Example API Used**

OpenWeatherMap API

Fetches real-time weather data for a selected city.
The system then uses this data to simulate suggestions, e.g.:
If it’s too cold, recommend to keep cats warm.
